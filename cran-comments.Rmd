```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Test environments
* local MAC OS 10.14.4 install, R 3.6.0
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R (devel and release)
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. 

There were 1 NOTES:

* checking dependencies in R code ... NOTE
  Namespace in Imports field not imported from: 'R6'

  R6 is a build-time dependency.

## Downstream dependencies
I have also run R CMD check on downstream dependencies of httr 
(https://github.com/wch/checkresults/blob/master/httr/r-release). 
All packages that I could install passed except:

* Ecoengine: this appears to be a failure related to config on 
  that machine. I couldn't reproduce it locally, and it doesn't 
  seem to be related to changes in httr (the same problem exists 
  with httr 0.4).
