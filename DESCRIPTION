Description: User supplies an amino acid sequence and optionally a codon usage frequency table to reverse translate to DNA or RNA nucleotides. Amino acids with  redundant codons are resolved by selection under a multinomial distribution  equal to a selected frequency table or by assuming uniform probabilities amongst the relevant codons. Users can also preferrentially limit the inclusion of rare codons and minimize GC content.
