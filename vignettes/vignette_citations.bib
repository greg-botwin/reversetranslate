abstract="Due to the degeneracy of the genetic code, most amino acids can be encoded by multiple synonymous codons. Synonymous codons naturally occur with different frequencies in different organisms. The choice of codons may affect protein expression, structure, and function. Recombinant gene technologies commonly take advantage of the former effect by implementing a technique termed codon optimization, in which codons are replaced with synonymous ones in order to increase protein expression. This technique relies on the accurate knowledge of codon usage frequencies. Accurately quantifying codon usage bias for different organisms is useful not only for codon optimization, but also for evolutionary and translation studies: phylogenetic relations of organisms, and host-pathogen co-evolution relationships, may be explored through their codon usage similarities. Furthermore, codon usage has been shown to affect protein structure and function through interfering with translation kinetics, and cotranslational protein folding.",

Programmatic access to these tools, which is fundamental to bioinformatics, is increasingly important as more high-throughput data is generated, e.g. from proteomics and metagenomic experiments. Access is available using both the SOAP and RESTful approaches and their usage is reviewed regularly in order to ensure that the best, supported tools are available to all users. We present here an update describing the latest enhancement to the Job Dispatcher APIs as well as the governance under it.}",
